## Intro to NLP

This repo contains a script with some functions I'm using for a presentation on basic Natural Language Processing.

I covers the following operations:

1. Tokenization
2. Finding similar words by meaning (using word vectors)
3. Finding similar words by spelling (using Levenshtein Distance)
